            <p>My name is Robert Pinney. I am originally from a small town in upstate New York named <a href="https://sherburne.org/">Sherburne</a>. 
                I went to Union college in Schenectady NY where I studied economics and Japanese. I worked at a local business in my hometown for a 
                few years before moving to Norway to live with my then girlfriend and now wife. We married in the southern part of Norway near Kristiansand 
                in 2005, and have since been so lucky to have 2 children, both girls, who make their mother and father very proud. We now live 
                in the rural town of <a href="https://vikersund.no/">Vikersund</a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since living in Norway I have worked as a carpenter, day-care assistant, prison security guard, and for the past 13 years as a
                 school teacher. The first 12 years as a highschool English/math teacher, but more recently as a full time teacher/assistant at my daughters 
                 elementary school, and even for a brief spell as her music teacher.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sadly I have discovered that teaching is no longer a satisfactory profession, and I have instead turned my head towards a 
                profession that has always intrigued me, namely programming. At the time of writing this text I am only about 1 month into my 
                studies and I am already creating a website that when done should look pretty sharp with my new HTML and CSS skills. In a
                few short weeks once I have learned some Javascript I hope to display some more serious programming skills as well as links
                to what will hopefully be many ongoing projects.
            <p><strong>Wish me luck!</strong>
